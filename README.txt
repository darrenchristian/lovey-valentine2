VALENTINE'S DAY WEB PAGE UPDATES

I've updated your web page to include a beautiful background image transition!

HOW TO ADD YOUR BACKGROUND IMAGE:
1.  Find the image you want to use (a portrait/vertical image works best).
2.  Rename the image file to "background.jpg" (ensure the extension matches).
3.  Place this file in the SAME folder as your index.html file: 
    c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Valentines2\

That's it! When you find all 5 hearts in the game, the background will smoothly transition to your image.

If you want to use a different file name or format (like .png):
1.  Open index.html in a text editor.
2.  Search for "body.found-hearts".
3.  Change "background.jpg" to your filename.
