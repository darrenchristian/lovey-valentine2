VALENTINE'S DAY WEB PAGE UPDATES

I've updated your web page to include background music!

HOW TO ADD YOUR MUSIC:
1.  Find the music file you want to use (MP3 format is best).
2.  Rename the file to "music.mp3".
3.  Place this file in the SAME folder as your index.html file: 
    c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Valentines2\

HOW TO ADD YOUR BACKGROUND IMAGE:
1.  Find your photo (portrait/vertical works best).
2.  Rename it to "background.jpg".
3.  Place it in the same folder.

NOTE ON AUTOPLAY:
Most modern browsers (like Chrome and Safari) BLOCK music from playing automatically until the user interacts with the page (clicks something).
- I have set it to TRY playing immediately.
- If blocked, it will wait for the first "click" anywhere on the page to start playing.
- There is also a small music button 🎵 in the bottom right corner to toggle it manually.
